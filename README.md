# car-insurance-prediction
In this project, I chose the topic of supervised learning, where I aim to predict whether customers contacted to participate in a campaign organized by a bank in South America will purchase car insurance or not. For this project, I used the Car Insurance Cold Calls dataset. This dataset comes from a bank in the United States and contains client information such as age, occupation, and more, as well as specific details about the current insurance sales campaign, such as communication type, last contact day, and information from previous campaigns, including previous attempts and outcomes. The model I used for prediction is Logistic Regression.
